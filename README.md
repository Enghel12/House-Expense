# House-Expenses

## Purpose of the program

The purpose of this program is to help the user calculate the water and electricity consumption of a house throughout a day and a month. This program can also help the user
save more money by showing him/her which house utilities consume the most water and electricity. All in all, this program was created to act as a calculator for power and water
consumption.

## How it works

To calculate the electricity consumption, the program expects the user to search the internet and look for the consumption in watt of each electronic device from the house. Then the user needs to manually enter the consumption of each electronic device. Then the program can start calculating the total consumption of electricity and show the results to the user.

The process to calculate the water consumption is quite different and much simpler. The user just needs to tell the program how much he/she uses the shower, the toilet, the 
dishwasher and all the other utilities that rely on water. Then the program will start calculating the total water consumption throughout a day and a month and inform the user.

## A cool feature regarding electricity consumption

Now there are three possible ways to calculate the electricity consumption: Average, Worst, Best case.

## How the user can save money

If the user enters correctly all the input that the program needs(water and electricity consumption), the program will show the user the Top 5 electronic devices that consume
the most electricity and the house utility that consumes the most amount of water. By learning this information, the user can start using these house utilities less in order to save money.

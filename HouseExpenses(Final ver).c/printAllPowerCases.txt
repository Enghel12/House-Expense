Now choose how would you like the consumtpion to be calculated
There are 3 cases, 1.Average 2.Worst case 3.Best case
If you pick average, the program will calculate the total consumption like this:
Let's say your refrigerator consumes between 100-300wats/hour, for this device the
program will calculate the average between these two values so: (100 + 300) / 2 = 200.
It will select the average value for each electronic device consumption and add it to
the total. So total = 200. Then it will select your next device, calculate the average
add it to the total and so on..

If you pick the worst case, the program will select the highest consumption of your device
throughout an hour(worst case). So if you have a TV that consumes between 200-600wats in an 
hour, the program will select the value 600, and add it to the total and then it will do the
same with the next device and so on..

If you pick the best case, the program will select the samllest consumption of your device, and
add it to the total.
